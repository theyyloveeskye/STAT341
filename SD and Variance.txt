Standard deviation is the quantity calculated to indicate the extent of deviation for a group as a whole. It measures the spread of the data about the mean value. It’s useful for comparing sets of data that might have the same mean but a different angle. When the standard is low that means that it is close to the mean and when it is high that means that the values are spread out over a wider range. Variance is the quality of being different, divergent, or inconsistent. It is the spread between numbers in a data set. It is also used to determine how far each number is from the mean and from every other number in the set. The difference between the two is that the standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the mean and the variance is expressed in square units. Standard deviation is good for interpretation and variance is better for developing the theory. The sum of uncorrelated distributions also has a variance that is the sum of the variances of those distributions. The standard deviation has the convenience of being expressed in units of the original variable. To sum it up, variance is just the average of squared deviations that gives an actual value to how much the numbers in a data set vary from the mean whereas standard deviation is the root mean square deviation and measures how far apart numbers are in a data set.
